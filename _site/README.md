# Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)

The [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) has issued the [Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_19_1.pdf) to advance the consolidation and optimization of the Federal Government’s inventory of data centers.  The DCOI supersedes the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and addresses requirements in the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).
