<p><strong>August 1, 2016</strong></p>

<p><strong>MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES</strong></p>

<p><strong>FROM: Tony Scott
Federal Chief Information Officer</strong></p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT: Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) Background</strong></p>

<p>In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the Federal
Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to promote the use of green
IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of
government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware,
software, and operations; increase the overall IT security posture of
the Federal Government; and shift IT investments to more efficient
computing platforms and technologies.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In December 2014, the President signed into law the Federal Information
Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA),<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> which enacts and builds
upon the requirements of the FDCCI. FITARA requires that agencies submit
annual reports that are to include: comprehensive data center
inventories, multi-year strategies to consolidate and optimize data
centers, performance metrics and a timeline for agency activities, and
yearly calculations of investment and cost savings.</p>

<p>In addition, FITARA requires the Administrator of the Office of
E-Government and Information Technology (henceforth referred to as the
Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>) to establish
and publish cost savings and optimization improvements, provide public
updates on cumulative cost savings and optimization improvements, and
review agencies’ data center inventories and the implementation of data
center management strategies.</p>

<p>This memorandum defines a framework for achieving the data center
consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA, the criteria for
successful agency data center strategies, and the metrics OMB OFCIO will
use to evaluate the success of those strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Policy</strong></p>

<p>As of August 1, 2016, the FDCCI is superseded by the Data Center
Optimization Initiative (DCOI) established in this memorandum.</p>

<p>The DCOI, as described in this memorandum, requires agencies to develop
and report on data center strategies to consolidate inefficient
infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture,
achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure,
such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The requirements in this memorandum apply to all CFO Act agencies,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>
including the Department of Defense.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Leadership and Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>All data center infrastructure and services, including contracts for
third-party data centers and services agency-wide, shall be managed by
the agency CIO in a manner consistent with FITARA<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> and OMB Memorandum
M-15-14, “Management and Oversight of Information Technology.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The
agency CIO shall be responsible for implementing and measuring progress
toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum.</p>

<p><strong>Transition to Cloud and Data Center Shared Services</strong></p>

<p><strong>Development Freeze for New and Current Data Centers</strong></p>

<p>Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies may not
budget any funds or resources toward initiating a new data center or
significantly expanding<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> an existing data center without approval from
OMB OFCIO.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> To request such approval, agencies must submit a written
justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including
opportunities for cloud services, inter-agency shared services, and
third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction in the
agency’s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or
expanded data center (such as through consolidation of multiple existing
data centers into a single new data center).</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation and Closure of Existing Data Centers</strong></p>

<p>As previously required by the FDCCI, agencies shall continue to
principally reduce application, system, and database inventories to
essential enterprise levels by increasing the use of virtualization to
enable pooling of storage, network and computer resources, and dynamic
allocation on-demand. Thereafter, agencies shall evaluate options for
the consolidation and closure of existing data centers,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> by (in order
of priority):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Transitioning to provisioned services, including configurable and
flexible technology such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform
as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to the
furthest extent practicable, consistent with the Cloud First
policy.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrating to inter-agency shared services or co-location data
centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrating to more optimized data centers within the agency’s data
center inventory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cloud Investment</strong></p>

<p>Cloud environments are scalable and allow agencies to provision
resources as required, on- demand.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> Consistent with the Cloud First
policy, agencies shall use cloud infrastructure where possible when
planning new mission or support applications or consolidating existing
applications. Agencies should take into consideration cost, security
requirements, and application needs when evaluating cloud environments.
As required by FITARA, agencies utilizing cloud services shall do so in
a manner that is consistent with requirements of the Federal Risk and
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Shared Services Managing Partner</strong></p>

<p>To support the shared services efforts described by this memorandum, the
General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy
(OGP) shall serve as the managing partner of the Federal Government’s
data center line of business<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> and data center shared services. OGP, in
consultation with the Unified Shared Services Management office, shall
establish and maintain a data center shared services marketplace and
coordinate shared services for inter-agency consumption by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Coordinating with OMB to define qualifying operating standards for
inter-agency shared services providers, creating guidance materials
for becoming such a provider, and identifying and approving
candidate providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining and monitoring inter-agency shared services provider
operating standards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining an online inventory of qualified inter-agency shared
services providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establishing an online decision support tool to facilitate agency
review, selection, and analysis of inter-agency shared services providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coordinating with the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to
create and maintain an inventory of acquisition tools and products specific to the technology and services surrounding data center optimization, including procurement vehicles for the acquisition of automated infrastructure management and monitoring tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developing, implementing, and maintaining financial and service
models, as well as contracts, pertaining to data center procurement
with customer/partner agencies and shared service providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing a forum for participating and interested agencies to
discuss the inter-agency shared services marketplace.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this role, OGP will serve as a trusted agent and subject matter
expert to assist data center providers and consumers of data center
services by providing guidance on technology advancements, innovation,
cybersecurity, and best practices.</p>

<p>All agencies will have the option of submitting data centers of their
choosing for review by OGP. Data centers that OGP determines
satisfactory in all of their operating standards will be designated as
inter-agency shared services providers.</p>

<p><strong>Optimization of Physical Data Centers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Classification of Physical Data Centers</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of this memorandum, rooms with at least one server,
providing services (whether in a production, test, staging, development,
or any other environment) are considered data centers. However, rooms
containing only print servers, routing equipment, switches, security
devices (such as firewalls), or other telecommunications components
shall not be considered data centers. Agencies shall perform a
comprehensive review of their data center inventories and continue to
maintain complete and updated data center inventories. This
comprehensive review shall be completed by August 31, 2016, to align
with the Integrated Data Collection (IDC) process.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Data centers shall be categorized into two groups: tiered<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> data centers
and non-tiered data centers. Tiered data centers are defined as those
that utilize each of the following: 1) a separate physical space for IT
infrastructure; 2) an uninterruptible power supply; 3) a dedicated
cooling system or zone; and 4) a backup power generator for prolonged
power outages. All other data centers shall be considered non-tiered
data centers.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Private sector-provided cloud services are not
considered data centers for the purposes of this memorandum, but must
continue to be included in agencies’ quarterly inventory data
submissions to OMB.</p>

<p>Agencies shall self-classify data centers as either tiered or non-tiered
data centers based on the above criteria; however, any data center
previously reported to OMB as a Tier 1-4 data center shall be
automatically categorized as a tiered data center.</p>

<p>Under this memorandum, OMB sets closure and optimization targets that
are applicable to each type of data center. Additionally, the terms
“core” and “non-core” will no longer be used as the categorical
benchmarks for OMB oversight.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Metering and Power Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Agencies shall install automated energy metering tools and shall use
these to collect and report energy usage data in their data centers to
OMB. The March 19, 2015, Executive Order 13693, “Planning for Federal
Sustainability in the Next Decade,” requires agencies to install and
monitor advanced energy meters in data centers by September 30, 2018.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Consistent with the Implementing Instructions for Executive Order 13693
(E.O. Implementing Instructions), energy metering tools shall enable the
active tracking of PUE for the data center and shall be installed in all
tiered Federal data centers by September 30, 2018.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> The E.O.
Implementing Instructions also advise that “[a]ll existing and new
data centers shall have at least one certified Data Center Energy
Practitioner (DCEP) assigned to manage its performance.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, agency CIOs are also
required under this memorandum to ensure that existing tiered data
centers achieve and maintain a PUE of less than 1.5 by September 30,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Agency CIOs shall evaluate options for consolidation or closure of
existing data centers in which a PUE target of less than 1.5 is not
cost-effective, such as through transition to cloud services or
migration to inter-agency shared services data centers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Accordingly, OMB will monitor the energy efficiency of data center power
and cooling infrastructure through the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
metric. Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, effective
immediately, all new data centers must implement energy metering capable
of measuring PUE and must be designed and operated to maintain a PUE no
greater than 1.4, and are encouraged to be designed and operated to
achieve a PUE no greater than 1.2.</p>

<p>To the extent permissible under the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR), agencies must include PUE requirements for all new data center
contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any new data center contract
or procurement vehicle must require the contractor to report the
quarterly average PUE of the contracted facility<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> to the contracting
agency, except where that data center’s PUE is already being reported
directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a multi-agency service
program. Agencies are encouraged to require the same for extension of
existing vehicles. PUE reporting is not required for cloud services.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Infrastructure Management</strong></p>

<p>Agencies shall replace manual collections and reporting of systems,
software, and hardware inventory housed within data centers with
automated monitoring, inventory, and management tools (e.g., data center
infrastructure management) by the end of fiscal year 2018. These tools
shall provide the capability to, at a minimum, measure progress toward
the server utilization and virtualization metrics defined in the Metric
Target Values section of this memorandum.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>Any data center initiation, significant expansion, or migration project
that receives Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (DM&amp;E) funds
in fiscal year 2017 and beyond must immediately implement automated
monitoring and management tools. However, agencies are strongly
encouraged to implement automated monitoring and management tools
throughout their data centers immediately.</p>

<p>To the extent permissible under the FAR, agencies must include automated
infrastructure management requirements for all new data center service
contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any new data center
contractor procurement vehicle must require the contractor to report to
the contracting agency whether the contracted facility utilizes
automated infrastructure management, except where such data is already
being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a
multi-agency service program. Agencies are encouraged to require the
same for extension of existing vehicles.</p>

<p>GSA shall make available an acquisition vehicle for automated monitoring
and management tools to support agency needs. Once established, agencies
shall not issue new solicitations for these requirements unless they
have developed a business case, approved by the agency’s CIO and shared
with OMB, to establish that the separate procurement of these needs
results in better value, considering price and other appropriate
factors.</p>

<p><strong>Metric Target Values</strong></p>

<p>OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following
optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly
basis, by way of agencies’ quarterly data center inventory submissions.
These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to
all data centers at agency facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 1: Optimization</strong></p>

<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority.
Agencies shall achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end
of fiscal year 2018:</p>

<p>Only the Server Utilization &amp; Automated Monitoring optimization metric
shall apply to non-tiered data centers. High-performance computing

Server Utilization &amp; Automated Monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance</strong></p>

<p>Agencies shall, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce Government-wide
annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%,
relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data
submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Agencies shall collectively
achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost
avoidance)<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:</p>

      <td>$2.7 billion</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will set
individual cost savings and cost avoidance goals for each agency.</p>

<p><strong>Goal 3: Closed Data Centers</strong></p>

<p>In all cases, the term “closed” for data centers shall refer exclusively
to tiered or non-tiered data centers that: a) no longer consume power
for physical servers; or b) no longer house physical servers (whether in
a production, test, stage, development, or any other environment).<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>

<p>Based on the number of data centers designated by the agencies as
already undergoing some part of the closure process, agencies currently
plan to close 22% of tiered data centers and 50% of non-tiered,
non-cloud data centers, for a total of 44% of all Federal data centers.
OMB’s goal for the DCOI is informed by, but exceeds, agencies’ existing
closure plans.</p>

<p>By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies shall close at least 25% of
tiered data centers government-wide, excluding those approved as
inter-agency shared services provider data centers. Furthermore,
agencies must close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government-
wide.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of
the overall Federal data center inventory and a reduction of
approximately 31%<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> in the gross floor area occupied by data centers
government-wide. Agencies shall prioritize the closure of data centers
that are unable to meet applicable PUE optimization targets and/or pose
management or security challenges due to age.</p>

<p>In the long term, all agencies should continually strive to close all
non-tiered data centers. Server rooms and closets pose security risks
and management challenges and are an inefficient use of resources. As
such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers are required to
be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies
will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.</p>

<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will share
with each agency its individual goal for data center closures,
specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered data centers
the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific
targets data centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT
hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling devices, sensors, etc.) and that
perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide
general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities).</p>

<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compliance Measurement</strong></p>

<p>Data will be collected quarterly on an agency-by-agency basis through
the IDC, as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Agencies must continue to maintain complete inventories of all data
center facilities, closure/consolidation plans, and properties of
each facility owned, operated, or maintained by or on behalf of the
agency.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agencies must include progress toward meeting all optimization
metric target values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agencies must evaluate the costs of operating and maintaining
current facilities and develop year-by-year targets for cost savings and cost avoidance du to consolidation and optimization for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 Agencies shall report all realized cost savings and cost avoidanc under the DCOI.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Strategic Plan</strong></p>

<p>In accordance with FITARA,<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> beginning in fiscal year 2016, each agency
head shall annually publish a Strategic Plan to describe the agency’s
consolidation and optimization strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and</p>
<ol>
  <li>The DCOI Strategic Plan and milestones described below replace
existing FDCCI requirements for consolidation plans.</li>
</ol>

<p>Agencies DCOI Strategic Plans must include, at a minimum, the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Planned and achieved performance levels for each optimization
metric, by year;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planned and achieved closures, by year;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An explanation for any optimization metrics and closures for which
the agency did not meet the planned level in a previous Strategic Plan;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Year-by-year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending
and cost savings on data centers from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, including:</p>

    <p>a.  A description of any initial costs for data center consolidation and optimization; and</p>

    <p>b.  Life cycle cost savings and other improvements (including those beyond fiscal year 2018, if applicable);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historical costs, cost savings, and cost avoidances due to data
center consolidation and optimization through fiscal year 2015; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statement from the agency CIO stating whether the agency has
complied with all reporting requirements in this memorandum and the data cente requirements of FITARA. If the agency has not complied with al reporting requirements, the agency must provide a statement describin the reasons for not complying.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Agencies are required to publish their Strategic Plans at
[agency].gov/digitalstrategy under a section entitled, “Data Center
Optimization Initiative Strategic Plans,” within 60 days of the issuance
of this memorandum. Subsequent Strategic Plan updates shall be due on
April 14, 2017 and April 13, 2018. Strategic plans shall also be made
available in a machine-readable JSON format at

OMB will provide instructions to agencies, including a schema, at
https://management.cio.gov/schema within 5 days of the issuance of this
memorandum.</p>

<p>Agencies shall furthermore update their
[agency].gov/digitalstrategy/FITARAmilestones.json files, also posted
on their websites, to identify, at a minimum, 5 milestones per fiscal
year to be achieved through the DCOI. DCOI milestones shall be updated
quarterly as progress is achieved and shall be reviewed in quarterly
PortfolioStat sessions with agencies’ OMB desk officers.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>

<p>Under FITARA,<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> OMB must make publicly available agencies’ progress
toward the goals established herein and relative to agencies’ Strategic
Plans.</p>

<p>To this end, beginning in 2016, OMB will report on government-wide and
agency-specific data center progress as part of the IT Dashboard, which
will display:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Planned and achieved data center closures by agency;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government-wide and agency progress toward meeting applicable
optimization targets;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative cost savings and cost avoidance realized through the
implementation of the DCOI and prior initiatives; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annual data center investment spending per agency, including
investment transition costs, cost savings projections, progress made
against projections and improvements realized through the
implementation of the strategy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
